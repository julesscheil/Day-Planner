# Day-Planner
This day planner will allow users to dynamically change and add tasks/events to their planner for the day.
Each event/task will be locally stored so upon refreshing the page, the data should persist.
Here is a screenshot of the planner: ![Portfolio Site](./assets/images/screenshot.png)
